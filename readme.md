## ConstancyJS

### Description

This repository contains JavaScript code for creating various animations on an HTML element. The animations include linear movement, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out transitions, color randomization, scaling, rotation, random movement, fading in, and fading out effects.

### Animation Functions

- **Linear Animation**: Moves the element horizontally from the starting position to the ending position at a constant speed.
- **Ease-In Animation**: Applies a smooth acceleration effect to the animation, starting slowly and gradually increasing in speed.
- **Ease-Out Animation**: Applies a smooth deceleration effect to the animation, starting at a constant speed and gradually slowing down.
- **Ease-In-Out Animation**: Combines the ease-in and ease-out effects, starting slowly, accelerating in the middle, and slowing down again at the end.
- **Color Randomization**: Randomly changes the background color of the element every second.
- **Scaling**: Scales the element randomly between 1 and 1.5 every two seconds.
- **Rotation**: Rotates the element randomly between 0 and 360 degrees every 1.5 seconds.
- **Random Movement**: Moves the element to a random position within the window every three seconds.
- **Fading In**: Fades the element in by gradually increasing its opacity every second.
- **Fading Out**: Fades the element out by gradually decreasing its opacity every two seconds.

### Usage

Simply include the provided JavaScript code in your project and ensure that the targeted HTML element has the appropriate ID ('animatedElement' in this case). You can customize the animations by modifying the parameters and adding or removing animation functions as needed.
